				<p>	Welcome to the About page for the game "coin collector", the purpose of this page is to dislay information about my game and to provide links back to owners of content that i have used (images and music).</p>	
				
				<P>Lets start with my content, all content was retrieved from various different areas in the web, no single place was used to grab all of my content.</p>
				<p>Meowth - http://trophygarden.eu/forum/images/smilies/meowth.gif </br> Level up noise - http://www.freesound.org/people/jivatma07/sounds/76234/ </br> Coin - http://www.top1gaming.com/images/wonderlandonline//wishing_coin.gif </br> Collision noise - http://www.freesound.org/people/kwanba/sounds/116332/ </br> Background music - http://www.youtube.com/user/MafiaFLairBeatz </br> sad trombone/ end of game effect - http://soundfxnow.com/sound-fx/sad-trombone-wah/</p>
				
				<P>This game can run locally and has been tested to work on both keyboard, mouse and mobile touch screen devices. However touch screen devices have a limitation where you can't access the achievements or help menu as they rely on keyboard presses from listen events rather then a text box and no virtual keyboard is triggered for the mobile device.</p>
				<h2>Key features</h2>
				<p>Increased level difficulty, each coin produces a new rock which adds to the list of objects to avoid.</p>
				<p>Local achievements! all achievements are stored locally and cover a wide range of different datasets.</p>
				<p>Pausing the game with the 'p' button.</p>
				<p>Muting the background noise with the button located external to the canvas.</p>
				<p>Support for keyboard and mouse controls.</p>
